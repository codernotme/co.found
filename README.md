## **About Co.Found**  

**Co.Found** is an online platform built to bridge the gap between founders and developers. Our mission is to empower entrepreneurs by making it easy to find technical co-founders who share their passion and vision.  

### **Key Features**  
1. **Profile Creation**:  
   - Founders can create profiles showcasing their startup ideas, vision, and the roles they need.  
   - Developers can create profiles that highlight their skills, experiences, and portfolios.  

2. **Application Process**:  
   - Developers can browse startup profiles and apply to those that resonate with them.  
   - Founders receive applications that include the developerâ€™s skills and expectations.  

3. **Matching System**:  
   - Founders are notified of new applications and can review them to accept or reject.  

4. **Direct Communication**:  
   - Post-acceptance, founders gain access to developersâ€™ WhatsApp numbers for quick collaboration.
